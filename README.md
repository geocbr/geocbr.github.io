# what is geoCBR?
geoCBR is a place for geospatial and geospatially-interested humans in Canberra and the region nearby to build communities. Expect to see social and other geo-related events turn up!

We start with #geobeersCBR, and see where things grow...

# who runs geoCBR?
you, hopefully! geoCBR is currently curated by:
- Adam Steer (http://github.com/adamsteer)

# how does geoCBR operate?
Until we have our own Code of Conduct, we'll borrow this one: https://foss4g-oceania.org/attend/code-conduct

Whatever we make here needs to be open source, and easy to access. it is also meant to be educational in a non-pointy-clicky way. Some code editing may be required to participate, but it should be really easy, straightforward code editing.

geoCBR is aiming to be both a community and a gateway drug to the rabbit hole of open geospatial wonderland.

# will geoCBR accept money to show paid events?
maybe. if so the fees will go toward hosting this community and donating to open source geospatial projects. Or expect proof-of-donation to an open source geospatial project as payment.
