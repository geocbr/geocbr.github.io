# what is geoCBR?
geoCBR is a place for geospatial and geospatially-interested humans in Canberra and the region nearby to build communities. Expect to see social and other geo-related events turn up!

We start with #geobeersCBR, and see where things grow...

# ...but I can't code!
That's OK. Just turn up to an event, make an awesome map, mentor someone, ask someone to mentor you, run an event - there are heaps of ways to be part of geoCBR. 

# who runs geoCBR?
you, hopefully! geoCBR is currently curated by:
- Adam Steer (http://github.com/adamsteer)
- Rowan Winsemius (https://github.com/rowanwins)

# how does geoCBR operate?
Until we have our own Code of Conduct, we'll borrow this one: https://foss4g-oceania.org/attend/code-conduct

Whatever we make here needs to be open source, and easy to access. it is also meant to be educational in a non-pointy-clicky way. Some code editing may be required to participate, but it should be really easy, straightforward code editing.

geoCBR is aiming to be both a community and a gateway drug to the rabbit hole of open geospatial wonderland.

# will geoCBR accept money to show paid events?
maybe. if so the fees will go toward hosting this community and donating to open source geospatial projects. Or expect proof-of-donation to an open source geospatial project as payment.

# how do I change things on the geoCBR website?
Fork this repository, make changes, and submit pull requests! Look at the issues list for ideas. We'd love you to propose new things in issues so we can discuss them; and then go for pull requests. But really, we'll all discuss pull requests anyway, so however it works best for you is good.
